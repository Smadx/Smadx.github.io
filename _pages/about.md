Iâ€™m an M.S. student at the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, the University of Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Chang](https://www.xiaojun.ai/). I have also spent time at Microsoft, advised by  [Yaobo Liang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yalia/) and [Jiaolong Yang](https://jlyang.org/).  

My research focuses on Embody AI especially the design and fine-tuning of Vision-Language-Action models(VLAs), as well as reinforcement learning and its applications in robotics. *Iâ€™m always open to research collaborations, especially those involving Embodied AI or interdisciplinary applications. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if youâ€™re interested in working together.*
